                          <p class="text-justify text-black ovaflowprofile">Mr kandaku mgwalu born on 30th November, 1964. A native of Enugwu-Ukwu in Njikoka Local Government of Anambra State, she had her primary education at T.T.C. Primary School, Enugu, and attended Uwani Secondary School, also in Enugu for her secondary education. Dr. Okonkwo gained admission into the prestigious University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), where she graduated with honours degree in Biochemistry in 1988. In 1990, she obtained a Postgraduate degree in Education that qualified her to teach in Nsukka High School, Nsukka for five years. In 1998, she obtained her Masters degree in Biochemistry from the same University of Nigeria, Nsukka. By this time, she had been employed as an Administrative Officer in her alma mater. Due to her quest for academic/self development, she felt that enrolling for Ph.D in Biochemistry which demanded intensive laboratory work would never allow for efficiency and effective administrative duties, hence, she enrolled for a second Masters programme in Education and bagged a Masters degree in Education in 2014. In 2019, she obtained her PhD in Educational Foundations from her alma mater.
                              Dr. Stella Okonkwo started her career as a University Administrator on 30th October, 1997 as an Administrative Officer. Following positive appraisals due to her hard work and dedication to her duties, she was promoted to the rank of Assistant Registrar in 2002, she continued to progress in rank to the position of Deputy Registrar in 2014. Dr. Okonkwo held this position up to June of 2019 when she had to proceed on leave of absence from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, to pick up an appointment as the third substantive Registrar of Veritas University, Abuja.                                
                              Before her appointment as Registrar of Veritas University, Abuja, Dr. Stella Okonkwo has served in several administrative positions and Committees in University of Nigeria, some of which include the Personnel Services Department (1997-2003), Admissions Unit of the Registry (2003-2010), Student Records and Institutional Research Unit (2010-2017) and the Deputy Registrar in the Office of the Vice-Chancellor (2017-2019), Chairman Junior Staff Central Appointment Committee (2016-2019), Secretary to Joint Council/Senate Committee on Investigation into Allegations of Misconduct Leveled Against Staff of the University (2002-2004), Secretary Council Ad-hoc Committee on Petition of UNN Staff to Prof. A.S. Galadanchi Visitation Panel 1985-1998 (2002-2003) to mention a few, and all in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.                                
                              Dr. Okonkwo has attended many national and international conferences/workshops and has also served various bodies outside of the university system. She received several awards and honours with the most recent being the Award of Excellence by the University of Nigeria, Nsukka- Executive Council of Peter Odili Postgraduate Hall, UNN.
                              Dr. Okonkwo is happily married to Professor Thomas Muoemene Okonkwo. The marriage is blessed with five children and a grandson. Our goal is be an international leader in research, teaching and exemplary service delivery. Education,
                              research and collaboration indeed, all activities at the Faculty must be permeated by basic democratic values
                              like equal treatment, non-discrimination and gender equality. Work at the Faculty must also contribute to
                              sustainable long-term development and a better world.This goal applies both to the Faculty of Law as a workplace and
                              to the content of the education, research and collaboration pursued at the Faculty

                          <p class="text-justify">The Student Counseling Unit is a mental health partner to all our students. You are at university primarily to study, and to graduate in record time! During this time, it is essential to stay focused on the important academic goals and to manage life stressors and unexpected events in an optimal way.</p>
                          <p class="text-justify">The University emphasises human development as reflected in all her activities. To this end, the Counselling Centre was established to provide an array of integrated services. The Centre's approach is to provide personalised care to members of the University community (especially students), to help them function more effectively.</p>
                          <p class="text-justify">Our mission is to foster a learning environment where personal awareness and professional identity are paramount. We train students to be reflective and practice with integrity.</p>
                          <p class="text-justify">Our graduates develop holistic and developmentally informed understandings of the people they serve and empower them in ways that instill hope, embrace diversity, and create optimal wellness.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Guided by the code of ethics of the Psychology and Counselling professions, the Centre promotes the privacy and confidentiality of clients by treating every information obtained during counselling sessions with the utmost discreetness. Clients can, however, sign for their information to be released to a third party for further intervention if the need arises. The Centre works in collaboration with the Veritas Medical Centre, the Chaplaincy, Student Affairs, International Office & Linkages and the Student Council to deliver her services. A potential client can be self-referred or be referred by anyone, including a parent or guardian.</p>

A therapy group consists of a small number of people, usually not more than eight or ten, and one or two trained group Counsellor(s). Group therapy offers a unique opportunity of joining a small group of people who share common concerns. The purpose of the group is to provide a safe as well as challenging place in which to work on personal and interpersonal concerns. Members can discuss perceptions of each other and give and receive feedbacks on how they are perceived by others. Therapy groups are different from other groups because everything that happens in the group is confidential; what is talked about or disclosed is not discussed outside the group.</p>
                                              <p class="text-black text-bold text-justify">Establishing a level of trust allows group members to talk openly and honestly. The group members and therapists work together to establish trust and commitment to the group. The first few sessions usually focus on the establishment of trust, as well as other ground rules for the group. Groups are designed to foster active learning, a place to work on issues rather that just talk about them. Members often experience in the group the same difficulties they have elsewhere. The group, with the help of the therapist, is able to give support and understanding, offer suggestions, or gently confront the person. Groups offer opportunities to experiment with different ways of communicating with others and to try new behaviors. Those who benefit most are usually those who take an active part in the process and who allow themselves to give and receive honest, helpful feedback. Group counselling also provides opportunities to learn that others have similar difficulties and to also learn about oneself as others works on their own problems. In an atmosphere of mutual concern, members can care about and help each other.</p>

                                              <p class="text-justify text-black text-bold">Interpersonal relationship skills such as healthy communication, conflict resolution, and cooperative goal setting are often fostered as key parts of treatment. With the assistance of the therapist, many couples develop a more intimate, satisfying, and healthy relationship and learn skills, which help the relationship continue to grow after counselling has ended. Couple counselling is available to students, faculty and staff, even if their partner is neither a student nor employee of CU.</p>

While most students cope successfully with the demands of college life, for some, the pressures can become overwhelming and unmanageable. Students in difficulty have a number of resources available to them. These include close friends, relatives, the chaplain, and coaches.

Competent clinical professionals who can assist students in times of personal crisis are available at the Veritas Univeristy Counseling Unit. Staff at the Centre can also provide debriefing for traumatic events that may occur on campus, such as in the student’s Halls of Residence, or in an academic department for faculty and staff.</p>
