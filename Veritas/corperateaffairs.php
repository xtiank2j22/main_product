                        <h6 class=" letter-space-4 text-navy text-uppercase mt-0 mb-0 ">About the Director Corperate Affairs</h6>
                        <p class="text-justify text-black ovaflowprofile">Mr John Ogawas born on 30th November, 1964. A native of Enugwu-Ukwu in Njikoka Local Government of Anambra State, she had her primary education at T.T.C. Primary School, Enugu, and attended Uwani Secondary School, also in Enugu for her secondary education. Dr. Okonkwo gained admission into the prestigious University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), where she graduated with honours degree in Biochemistry in 1988. In 1990, she obtained a Postgraduate degree in Education that qualified her to teach in Nsukka High School, Nsukka for five years. In 1998, she obtained her Masters degree in Biochemistry from the same University of Nigeria, Nsukka. By this time, she had been employed as an Administrative Officer in her alma mater. Due to her quest for academic/self development, she felt that enrolling for Ph.D in Biochemistry which demanded intensive laboratory work would never allow for efficiency and effective administrative duties, hence, she enrolled for a second Masters programme in Education and bagged a Masters degree in Education in 2014. In 2019, she obtained her PhD in Educational Foundations from her alma mater.
                            Dr. Stella Okonkwo started her career as a University Administrator on 30th October, 1997 as an Administrative Officer. Following positive appraisals due to her hard work and dedication to her duties, she was promoted to the rank of Assistant Registrar in 2002, she continued to progress in rank to the position of Deputy Registrar in 2014. Dr. Okonkwo held this position up to June of 2019 when she had to proceed on leave of absence from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, to pick up an appointment as the third substantive Registrar of Veritas University, Abuja.                                
                            Before her appointment as Registrar of Veritas University, Abuja, Dr. Stella Okonkwo has served in several administrative positions and Committees in University of Nigeria, some of which include the Personnel Services Department (1997-2003), Admissions Unit of the Registry (2003-2010), Student Records and Institutional Research Unit (2010-2017) and the Deputy Registrar in the Office of the Vice-Chancellor (2017-2019), Chairman Junior Staff Central Appointment Committee (2016-2019), Secretary to Joint Council/Senate Committee on Investigation into Allegations of Misconduct Leveled Against Staff of the University (2002-2004), Secretary Council Ad-hoc Committee on Petition of UNN Staff to Prof. A.S. Galadanchi Visitation Panel 1985-1998 (2002-2003) to mention a few, and all in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.                                
                            Dr. Okonkwo has attended many national and international conferences/workshops and has also served various bodies outside of the university system. She received several awards and honours with the most recent being the Award of Excellence by the University of Nigeria, Nsukka- Executive Council of Peter Odili Postgraduate Hall, UNN.
                            Dr. Okonkwo is happily married to Professor Thomas Muoemene Okonkwo. The marriage is blessed with five children and a grandson. Our goal is be an international leader in research, teaching and exemplary service delivery. Education,
                            research and collaboration – indeed, all activities at the Faculty – must be permeated by basic democratic values
                            like equal treatment, non-discrimination and gender equality. Work at the Faculty must also contribute to
                            sustainable long-term development and a better world.This goal applies both to the Faculty of Law as a workplace and
                            to the content of the education, research and collaboration pursued at the Faculty

The University occupies a pre-eminent position locally and regionally and it is its desire to enhance its reputation as a world-class university and a center of scholarly excellence. The Corporate affairs department will work with all the Directorates and Schools to promote the corporate image of the University.</p>
                            <p  class="text-justify">The long term goal of enhancing the image is to build a strong corporate identity and reputation that will open more business opportunities and enhance corporate support for the University. The University’s has exhibited a lot of strength and resilience in adapting to the changes in the corporate environment and I have a strong conviction that together we can transform the institution into a self-sustaining world class university that is committed to scholarly excellence. The environment in which the University operates has become increasingly dynamic, competitive and unpredictable.</p>
                            <p  class="text-justify">The University is also gradually evolving from the status of a public entity that is used to over-reliance on exchequer funding to one that is self-sustaining. To achieve a self-sustaining status, the University has to restructure its business processes in a manner that will inspire its stakeholders to support its development goals through enhanced capitation both from within and from without.</p>
                            <p>The University is intent in building its reputation as a world- class center of scholarly excellence in the face of the emerging challenges. It is therefore imperative to constantly review its strategic plan and align its strategic objectives to the national development agenda and the global development needs</p>
